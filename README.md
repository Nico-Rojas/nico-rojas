## <img src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/logos_page/GitHub-Mark.png" alt="GitHub Logo" width="30"/> **About Me**

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics and Education at Teachers College, Columbia University, and a 2023–24 Fellow of the National Academy of Education — one of the most competitive fellowships in the field of education policy.

I’m an applied microeconomist, where my research focuses on teacher shortages, the evaluation of financial aid, and school accountability policies. I am also an experienced R and Stata user, and have taught quantitative methods in both the Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences (QMSS) program and the School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA) at Columbia University.

- 🌱 I’m currently working on: Developing novel empirical tools to study teacher shortage policies.
- 🌱 Previously, I led the development of dashboards and statistical reports used to guide policy decisions, and worked on the design of the school accountability system in Chile. 
- 🧑‍🏫 I’m a T.A. of Data Analysis for Policy Research Using R for the second time.
