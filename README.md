## <img src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/logos_page/GitHub-Mark.png" alt="GitHub Logo" width="30"/> **About Me**

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics and Education at Teachers College, Columbia University, and a 2023–24 Fellow of the National Academy of Education—one of the most competitive fellowships in education policy.

I am an applied microeconomist whose research focuses on teacher shortages, the evaluation of financial aid, and school accountability policies. I am also an experienced R and Stata user, and have served as a teaching assistant in R courses in both the Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences (QMSS) program and the School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA) at Columbia University.

- 🌱 I’m currently working on developing novel empirical tools to study teacher shortage policies.
- 🌱 Previously, I led the development of dashboards and statistical reports to guide policy decisions, and contributed to the design of Chile’s school accountability system.
- 🌱 I have over 8 years of experience working with national and state data across multiple fields.
- 🧑‍🏫 I’m currently serving as a teaching assistant for Data Analysis for Policy Research Using R for the second time.
